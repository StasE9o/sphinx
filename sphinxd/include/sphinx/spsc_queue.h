/// \defgroup spsc-queue-module A bounded, single-producer/single-consumer (SPSC) wait-free and

///
/// A SPSC queue is a ring buffer with two indexes to the ring: head and tail. A producer writes new
/// entries in the queue after the current tail and a consumer reads entries from the head.
///
/// While the algorithm was implemented independently, the following implementations were used as
/// reference:
///
///  https://www.scylladb.com/2018/02/15/memory-barriers-seastar-linux/
///  https://github.com/rigtorp/SPSCQueue
///  https://github.com/fsaintjacques/disruptor--
///
/// Furthermore, the same algorithm is described in the following paper (including proof of
/// correctness):
///
///   LÃª, N.M., Guatto, A., Cohen, A. and Pop, A., 2013, October. Correct and
///   efficient bounded FIFO queues. In Computer Architecture and High Performance
///   Computing (SBAC-PAD), 2013 25th International Symposium on (pp. 144-151).
